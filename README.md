## 🌍 Overview

The Kenya Career & Skills Intelligence System bridges the gap between what Kenyan learners study and what the job market demands. It serves students from both the legacy **8-4-4 curriculum** and the new **Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC)**, as well as TVET diploma holders, graduates, and working professionals.

**What the system produces for each user:**

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🎯 **Top-5 Career Recommendations** | Personalised matches from 894 O\*NET occupations with alignment scores |
| ⚡ **AI Risk Rating** | Automation risk per career — Low / Medium / High / Very High |
| 📊 **Skills Gap Report** | Critical gaps, moderate gaps, and transferable strengths |
| 📚 **Learning Path** | Curated course sequence (Foundation → Intermediate → Advanced) from Coursera, edX, and Udemy |

## 🤖 Models & Algorithms

### Stage 1 — Career Recommendation

| Component | Choice | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Semantic encoder | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (Sentence Transformers) | 384-dim embeddings; understands Swahili, jargon, and field-specific language |
| Retrieval | `sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors` (cosine) | Fast broad recall — top-50 from 894 occupations |
| Ranking | `sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` | Learns optimal weights across skill match, demand, risk, zone fit, and keyword signals |
| Skill enrichment | 250+ synonym map + CBC/KCSE implicit boosts | Compensates for limited vocabulary in user free-text |

### Stage 2 — AI Risk Scoring

```
Blended Risk Score = 0.5 × BLS_automation_prob + 0.5 × skill_derived_risk

High-risk skill signals:  Operation & Control, Equipment Maintenance,
                          Operations Monitoring, Quality Control, Mathematics

Low-risk skill signals:   Social Perceptiveness, Judgment & Decision Making,
                          Instructing, Negotiation, Originality, Speaking

Future-Proof Score (0–100) = 40% demand + 40% (1 − risk) + 20% salary
```

### Stage 3 — Skills Gap Engine

- Cosine similarity between user skill vector and O\*NET occupation requirements
- `MinMaxScaler` for score normalisation
- Sentence Transformer embeddings for language-agnostic skill name resolution

### Stage 4 — Course Recommender

- `TfidfVectorizer` (15,000-feature vocabulary)
- Per-gap search (not career-title search) — targets the user's specific deficits
- Course level tiers: **Foundation** (5,555) → **Intermediate** (2,205) → **Advanced** (290)

## 🔑 Key Design Decisions

**SOC-Code-Based Career Family Mapping**
Career families are assigned using the first 2 digits of each O\*NET SOC code rather than fuzzy string matching against BLS titles. The prior approach (cutoff=0.55) misclassified occupations like "Security Guards" → Technology and "Shoe Machine Operators" → Technology. SOC-prefix mapping is deterministic and fully authoritative.

**Sentence Transformer for Skill Matching**
`all-MiniLM-L6-v2` understands meaning rather than exact keywords — it correctly maps Swahili skill terms, Kenyan-specific skills like "crop rotation" or "litigation", and colloquial descriptions to O\*NET canonical dimensions. TF-IDF alone would fail on vocabulary mismatch.

**CBC / KCSE Implicit Skill Enrichment**
Students who cannot name formal skills explicitly receive implicit skill boosts via curriculum pathway mappings (22 CBC pathways, 28 KCSE subjects). This is critical for Kenya's target user base where self-reported skill vocabulary is limited.

**Gap-Driven Course Search**
Course recommendations are generated per skill gap rather than per career title — ensuring every recommended course directly targets a specific deficit in the user's profile.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

| Limitation | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| No labelled evaluation dataset | Cannot report quantitative metrics (Precision@K, NDCG) yet |
| BLS covers only 102 / 894 occupations (11.4%) | Risk scores for 88.6% of occupations are skill-model estimates, not empirical |
| `skills_abr` missing from LinkedIn data | Cannot link skills directly to demand; title-level proxy used instead |
| No course duration data available | Learning-time estimates are unavailable |
| Risk distribution skewed (96.1% Low) | Threshold calibration may need adjustment against published automation research |

---

## 🗺 Roadmap

- [ ] Build labelled evaluation dataset via user study (50–100 participants per user type)
- [ ] Integrate Frey & Osborne (2013) automation probability data for risk calibration
- [ ] Add Kenyan job board data (BrighterMonday, MyJobMag) for local demand signals
- [ ] Replace static LinkedIn batch file with LinkedIn Job Search API
- [ ] Containerise system with Docker + FastAPI for production serving
- [ ] Add course duration via platform scraping
- [ ] Build a Swahili-first mobile UI for the CBC student segment
