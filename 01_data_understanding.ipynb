    "# Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Background Information\n",
    "\n",
    "The global labor market is undergoing rapid transformation driven by technological advancement, artificial intelligence (AI), automation, globalization, and the digital economy. Traditional career pathways are evolving, new job roles are emerging, and the skills required for employability are continuously changing. As a result, individuals — particularly students, graduates, and early-career professionals — often struggle to identify relevant career opportunities and the competencies needed to remain competitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Kenya, educational reforms such as the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) emphasize practical skills, creativity, and learner-centered career pathways. While these reforms aim to better prepare learners for the workforce, many students, parents, and educators still lack clear guidance on translating acquired competencies into viable career opportunities. Additionally, higher education institutions and Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) programs offer diverse learning pathways, yet alignment between these programs and labor market demands remains fragmented.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and digital learning platforms have expanded access to skill development opportunities globally. These platforms enable learners to acquire industry-relevant skills outside traditional academic environments. However, the large number of available courses often creates confusion regarding which learning pathways best support specific career goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, concerns about AI-driven job displacement are increasingly shaping workforce discussions. While some occupations face automation risks, others are emerging due to technological innovation. Understanding these trends is essential for informed career planning and workforce readiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these dynamics, there is a growing need for intelligent systems that integrate labor market data, education pathways, emerging skill requirements, and individual user profiles to provide actionable career guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Challenges Identified\n",
    "\n",
    "Several factors contribute to difficulties in career decision-making:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fragmented information about careers, required skills, and education pathways  \n",
    "- Skills mismatch between graduates and labor market demands  \n",
    "- Limited awareness of emerging careers and future workforce trends  \n",
    "- Rapid technological change affecting job stability  \n",
    "- Difficulty navigating multiple learning options such as university programs, TVET courses, and online certifications  \n",
    "- Limited personalized career guidance tools tailored to evolving labor market conditions  \n",
    "\n",
    "These challenges highlight the need for a data-driven approach to career guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "This project proposes the development of an **AI-driven Career and Skills Recommendation System** that integrates multiple data sources to provide personalized career insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system will incorporate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Labor market data from job postings and occupational datasets  \n",
    "- Skills extraction using Natural Language Processing (NLP)  \n",
    "- Education pathway mapping including universities, TVET programs, and certifications  \n",
    "- Online learning recommendations from MOOCs and digital learning platforms  \n",
    "- AI-driven insights on job trends, emerging careers, and automation risks  \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on user profiles (skills, education level, interests, career goals), the system will provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recommended career paths  \n",
    "- Required skills and competency levels  \n",
    "- Suggested academic programs or certifications  \n",
    "- Relevant learning resources and skill development pathways  \n",
    "- Future job outlook and industry trends  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Many students, graduates, and professionals face challenges identifying suitable career paths and the skills required to succeed in an evolving labor market. This is due to fragmented career information, emerging AI-driven job disruptions, evolving education systems, and the growing number of learning opportunities available through both traditional institutions and online platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is therefore a need for a holistic, data-driven career recommendation system that integrates labor market intelligence, education pathways, skill requirements, and future workforce trends to support informed career decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop an intelligent recommendation system that provides personalized career, skills, and education pathway suggestions based on labor market data, user profiles, and future workforce trends.\n",

    "- Recommend relevant academic programs, TVET courses, and MOOCs  \n",
    "- Identify skill gaps and suggest personalized learning pathways  \n",
    "- Develop a user-friendly platform for interactive career guidance  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "This project uses multiple datasets to support a **Career and Skills Intelligence Recommendation System** that connects:\n",
    "- career opportunities and job market demand,\n",
    "- skills and competency requirements,\n",
    "- education and training pathways,\n",
    "- AI/automation trends and workforce changes,\n",
    "- learning resources (MOOCs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the system is designed to be future-oriented and data-driven, we curated datasets that include:\n",
    "- job titles and job-level attributes (salary, education, experience),\n",
    "- AI impact indicators (exposure, automation probability, displacement risk),\n",
    "- online learning quality signals (course reviews/sentiment),\n",
    "- Course catalog / skill-to-course mapping: Coursera,\n",
    "- CBC pathway context (Kenya education tracks and competencies): cbc_data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets provide both structured data (tables) and semi-structured text data. In this notebook, we focus on:\n",
    "1) loading each dataset,\n",
    "2) inspecting its structure (rows/columns, dtypes, missingness),\n",
    "3) confirming whether the data supports our project objectives.\n",
    "\n",

    "Key attributes include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pathway:** The learner track/pathway (e.g., Business, TVET, Social Sciences).  \n",
    "- **subject:** The subject area within the pathway (e.g., Finance, Fashion Design).  \n",
    "- **skills_required:** Comma-separated skill statements associated with that subject/career.  \n",
    "- **competency_type:** CBC competency grouping (7 core competencies).  \n",
    "- **career:** A mapped career outcome (e.g., Investment Analyst, Fashion Designer).  \n",
    "- **industry_sector:** The sector where the career typically belongs (e.g., Government, NGO Sector, Corporate Sector).\n",
